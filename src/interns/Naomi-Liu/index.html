                I became a software engineer to continuously learn and challenge myself to remain openminded to new ideas and methodologies.
                A year ago, I was a toxicology student at UC Davis interning at UCD Health's pediatric emergency department, but the start of the pandemic
                led me to reconsider my career route as everything became remote. I adapted by redirecting my time and energy
                into a different interest, solving puzzles.

                I recently graduated from Hackbright's software engineering program. Through Lob's internship program, 
                I hope to build my credibility through hands on experience, utilized the software engineering skills
                I've acquired so far and learn what it takes to become an amazing software engineer.

                I would enjoy building software that people find useful and makes their lives easier. I like the artistic side of front
                end design and the asthetic choices that come with it.
