      <p> 
          I became a software engineer because I wanted to be in a career that would give me the opportunity to 
          continuously learn and challenge me to remain openminded to new ideas. For example,
          learning new frameworks and other ways of solving problems, but I hope that those qualities will transfer 
          to other areas of my life as well. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Initially, I turned to software engineering because I needed to adapted to the remote world we now live in. 
          I aquired the skills that I thought would be most valuable and now I am building my credibility through 
          experience. I hope that I will be able to gain that through interning with Lob and learn to be an amazing 
          software engineer. I enjoy the puzzle aspect of algorithms and the creativity that goes into building a project.
      </p>

         I would enjoy building software that people utilize and enjoy. Once I have more experience as a software
         engineer, I will be able to discern what I like creating, but at this point I would just be happy to work 
         on a project that people find useful and enjoy.
